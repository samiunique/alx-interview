Must Know<br>
For this project, you will need a solid understanding of several key concepts in order to develop a solution that can efficiently <br>
determine if all boxes can be opened. Hereâ€™s a list of concepts and resources that will be instrumental in tackling this project: <br>

Concepts Needed:<br>
[Lists and List Manipulation:](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)<br>

Understanding how to work with lists, including accessing elements, iterating over lists, and modifying lists dynamically.<br>
Python Lists (Python Official Documentation)<br>
[Graph Theory Basics:](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/graph-representation/a/representing-graphs)<br>

Although not explicitly required, knowledge of graph theory (especially concepts related to traversal algorithms like Depth-First <br>
Search or Breadth-First Search) can be very helpful in solving this problem, as the boxes and keys can be thought of as nodes and edges <br>
in a graph.<br>

[Algorithmic Complexity:](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/asymptotic-notation-and-analysis-based-on-input-size-of-algorithms/)<br>

Understanding the time and space complexity of your solution is important, as it can help in writing more efficient algorithms.

[Recursion:](https://realpython.com/python-recursion/)<br>

Some solutions might require a recursive approach to traverse through the boxes and keys.

[Queue and Stack:](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/queue-in-python/)<br>

Knowing how to use queues and stacks is crucial if implementing a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse through the keys and boxes.<br>

[Set Operations:](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets)<br>

Understanding how to use sets for keeping track of visited boxes and available keys can optimize the search process.<br>

By reviewing these concepts and utilizing these resources, you will be well-equipped to develop an efficient solution for this project, applying both your algorithmic thinking and Python programming skills.<br>
